# ELE690-2022: Myocardium Segmentation

## Image extraction
*get_images_and_masks.py* is used to extract images and Mmyocardium masks. In order to use this function it is currently required to have the files from [CardioMiner](https://github.com/Biomedical-Data-Analysis-Laboratory/CardioMiner). The variable *filepath* and *filepathDel* must both be used within the UNIX-server provided by the University of Stavanger. The extraction process takes between 10 and 30 min.
